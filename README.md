To use this download and run the files
if it prompts you to install packages say yes


once its downloaded you will probably need to update the rgb values of the targets you will be using
to do this you will:
 1. go to the targets in game and take a screenshot
 2. paste the screenshot into paint or paint3d
 3. use the eyedropper tool and select the color of the wool
 4. look at the RGB values and adjust them in the code accordingly
 4. the variables you need to change are the variables named "leftRGB" and "rightRGB"
     a. note that the "leftRGB" variable is referring to the color that is intended to make your character move left
     b. same goes for the "rightRGB" variable
     
if you are running it and it breaks a block where it is supposed to turn around, you should make sure the RGB values are acurate
and also make sure you are laying in windowed mode(f11)

TODO:
1. add a config file for items that are changed often 
2. add support for a range of RGB values
3. add better hotkey support
